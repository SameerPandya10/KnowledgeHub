# KnowledgeHub
This repository holds the code of an Online Library Website created by me which has a variety of books to read and various video lectures and notes to help ace undergrad examinations

In order to exprience my website on your system, please approach the following steps:


  1. Create a folder where you wish to clone the website and open terminal here  
  2. Write the following command in the terminal
      
          git clone https://github.com/SameerPandya10/KnowledgeHub.git        
        
  3. This will clone all the files into a sub-folder "KnowledgeHub" in the folder you cloned the website.
  4. Now move into the folder using the cd command as follows:
   
          cd KnowledgeHub/
         
  5. Now write the following command to download the node-modules into the folder "KnowledgeHub"  
 
          npm install node-modules                
                
  6. Download mysql on your system and copy the entire data in the "knowledgeHubDB.txt" file into the workbench/command line client to create the database
  7. This step completes the final setup of the website "KnowledgeHub" on your PC. Host the website on the server 4400 using following command in the terminal 

          node app.js
          
  8. Finally type this in the URL of any web browser to view and interact with this website
